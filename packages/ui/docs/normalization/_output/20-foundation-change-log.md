# 20 - Foundation Change Log

> Batch: Batch 3 - Migration Plan
> Branch: `feat/ui`
> Last reconciled: 2026-03-10
> Scope: Foundation-level decisions and doc-alignment updates that change how the `_output` set should be interpreted

## 2026-03-08 - Box Foundation Amendment Applied

Changed:
- Confirmed `Box` as the only implemented shared export in `@repo/ui`.
- Locked the extended `Box` API surface: `asChild`, `padding`, `container`, and `centered`.
- Confirmed `21-adapter-mapping.md` only covers `Box` because no other shared component is implemented yet.

Impact:
- All downstream planning artifacts must continue treating `Box` as the sole shipped shared primitive until another component is actually exported from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.

## 2026-03-09 - Batch 3A Token Bootstrap Completed

Changed:
- Confirmed the semantic token preset exists at `@repo/config/semantic-tokens.css`.
- Confirmed Batch 3A is complete and remains the hard gate before any Batch 4 shared build.
- Reaffirmed that shared styling must stay semantic-token-only.

Impact:
- Batch 4 may start from a foundation perspective, but component tracker rows stay `PLANNED` until implementation lands in `@repo/ui`.

## 2026-03-09 - Output Cross-Check Normalization Pass

Changed:
- Added the missing canonical API sections in `02-api-conventions.md` for every component previously referenced as `02 amendment`.
- Normalized `10-cross-app-reconciliation.md` target batch labels to `B3`, `B4`, and `B5.x` wave names.
- Corrected `13-implementation-batches.md` so Batch 4 status reflects the actual workspace state instead of prematurely marking components `DONE`.
- Updated `11-master-component-roadmap.md` to treat `02` alignment as an active contract, not a missing future task.

Impact:
- The `_output` document set is internally aligned again.
- Actual implementation state is now explicit: `Box` and Batch 3A are done; Batch 4+ shared components remain planned or blocked until code exists.

## 2026-03-10 - Box Batch 4 Re-execution Alignment

Changed:
- Re-executed `Box` against the Batch 4 extend-existing procedure instead of relying on the earlier Batch 3 pass alone.
- Made the `Box` type surface explicitly match `02-api-conventions.md` by declaring `className` on `BoxOwnProps`.
- Realigned Storybook metadata and stories to the canonical `Layout/Box` taxonomy and documented the approved semantic/layout usage cases.

Impact:
- `Box` remains the only valid `EXTEND_EXISTING` component in the current shared-program state, but its spec, stories, and exported prop surface are now consistent with the authoritative procedural contract.
